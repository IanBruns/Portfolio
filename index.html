          <p>
            Hello, my name is Ian!  I'm a student developer currently living in Denver, CO
          </p>
          <p>
            None of my current career path is what I would call standard, going from
            retail, then payroll, to going back to school in Thinkful, but I have learned a lot
            from these experience to better myself as a developer
          </p>
          <p>
            Stop by, take a look around, and if you want to get in touch, please do not
            hesitate to reach out!  I always enjoy working with equally passionate people
            to solve problems
          </p>

          <h2 class="tang-design">About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated college a little late in the game in 2017 at 25,
            and found my way to employment in the payroll and finance sector.  
            After a friend told me about the Thinkful program she had just 
            graduated I looked into it and started teaching myself to program
            (and got absorbed in the material)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I'm registered in the program, and I'm looking foward to honing
            the skills that I've already built in order to transition into a
            development role and working with other like minded students along
            the way!
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not programming, you can find me:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playing Ping Pong</li>
            <li>Practicing Instruments (I am up to about 6)</li>
            <li>Watching Movies</li>
          </ul>
